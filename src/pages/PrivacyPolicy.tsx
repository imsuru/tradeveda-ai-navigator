              This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
            </p>

            <p>
              This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data we collect, how we use and share it, along with details on how you can reach out to us with privacy-related inquiries. Additionally, the Policy outlines your rights as a data subject and choices you have, including the right to object to certain usages of your Personal Data by us. In this Policy, “LIQUID MIND®”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the LIQUID MIND® entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
            </p>

            <p>
              “Services” refer to the products and services provided by LIQUID MIND® under the LIQUID MIND® Services Agreement and the LIQUID MIND® Consumer Terms of Service. This may include devices and applications provided by LIQUID MIND®. Our “Business Services” are services that we provide to entities (“Business Users”) that directly and indirectly provide us with “End Customer” Personal Data in connection with their own business operations and activities. Our “End User Services” are those that LIQUID MIND® provides directly to individuals for their personal use. “Sites” refer to LIQUIDMIND®.ai and other LIQUID MIND® websites, apps, and online services. Collectively, we refer to Sites, Business Services, and End User Services as “Services.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-6">
              <li><span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">End User:</span> When you use an End User Service for personal use, such as signing up for Link, we refer to you as an "End User."</li>
              <li><span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">End Customer:</span> When you do business with, or otherwise engage in a transaction with a Business User, such as buying a shirt from a Business User using LIQUID MIND® Checkout for payment processing, but are not directly transacting with LIQUID MIND®, we refer to you as an "End Customer."</li>
              <li><span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Representative:</span> When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via LIQUID MIND® Issuing—we categorize you as a "Representative."</li>
              <li><span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Visitor:</span> When you interact with LIQUID MIND® by visiting a Site without being logged into a LIQUID MIND® account, or when your interaction with LIQUID MIND® does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, you are considered a "Visitor." For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to LIQUID MIND® asking for more information about our Services.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by LIQUID MIND® to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.
            </p>

            <p>
              Depending on the activity, LIQUID MIND® assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”) based on the activity.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it</h2>

            <p>
              Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service being utilized. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User utilizing our Services for payment processing.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">1.1 End Customers</h3>

            <p>
              LIQUID MIND® provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include in-person or online checkout payment processing or processing payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a data processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4 mb-2">a. Personal Data we collect about End Customers</h4>

            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Transaction Data.</span> If you're an End Customer making payments to, receiving refunds from, initiating a purchase or donation, or otherwise transacting with our Business User, whether in-person or online, we receive your Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transact with the Business User.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Identity/Verification Information.</span> LIQUID MIND® might use 3rd party verification and fraud prevention Services that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you might be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4 mb-2">b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers</h4>

            <p>
              To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we may use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them. Where allowed, we also use End Customers' Personal Data for LIQUID MIND®'s own purposes such as enhancing security, improving and offering our Business Services, and preventing fraud, loss, and other damages, as described further below.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Payment processing and accounting.</span> We may use your Transaction Data to deliver Payment-related Business Services to Business Users, including online payment transactions processing, sales tax calculation, invoice and bill handling, and helping them determine their revenue, settle their bills, and execute accounting tasks. We may also use your Personal Data to provide and improve our Business Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              During potential payment transactions, your Personal Data is shared with various entities in connection to your transaction. As a service provider or data processor, we may share Personal Data to enable transactions as directed by Business Users. Please review their privacy policies for more information about how they use and share your Personal Data.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Financial services.</span> Certain Business Users may leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via LIQUID MIND® or our Financial Partners. In addition to any Transaction Data we may generate or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we also collect and utilize your Personal Data to provide and manage these products, including assisting our Business Users in preventing misuse of the cards. Please review the privacy policies of the Business User and, if applicable, our bank partners associated with the financial service (the brands of which may be shown on the card) for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Identity/Verification services.</span> We may utilize Personal Data about your identity, including information provided by you and our service providers, to perform verification services for LIQUID MIND® or for the Business Users that you are transacting with, to prevent fraud and enhance security. If you provide a selfie along with an image of your identity document, we may employ biometric technology to compare and calculate whether they match and verify your identity.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Fraud detection and loss prevention.</span> We may use your Personal Data collected from your engagement with our Business Users and your devices to prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor and prevent loss, and protect our Business Services. We conduct this fraud prevention for our own protection and for the protection of our Business Users and others. If we detect activities that may be fraudulent or harmful, we may decline the transaction and share this information with the affected Business User or others, as permitted.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you directly use our End User Services, we act as a data controller with respect to your Personal Data. For example, we are a data controller when you sign up for a LIQUID MIND® account to make payments or use other features for your personal use.

            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">India</h3>

            <p>
              In some cases, and as permitted under the DPDPA, we may rely on “legitimate use” as a legal basis. For example, we do so when you voluntarily provide your Personal Data to us. “Consent Managers” as defined under the DPDPA may submit a request to revoke or provide consent using the methods described in the Contact Us section below, or as set out in the following paragraph, or via other means made available by LIQUID MIND® in the future. We may ask for proof of authorization and identity before processing such a request.
            </p>

            <p>
              In certain cases, you may be asked to consent to the collection and processing of your Aadhaar number by LIQUID MIND® India Private Limited and/or its third party verification partner(s). The purpose of this collection is to facilitate the identification verification process as required under applicable laws. Your provision of Aadhaar details is purely voluntary, and you may provide other identification documents as may be accepted by us from time to time. You will not be denied service merely for not submitting Aadhaar details.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you have any questions or complaints regarding the processing of your Personal Data in India, or if you want to receive this Policy or communicate with us about privacy in one of India's official languages, please contact our nodal or grievance officer at reachus (at) liquidmind (dot) ai. If we are unable to address your complaint or grievance, you have the right to escalate the matter to the Data Protection Board of India.

            <p>
              If you are a consumer located in the United States (“US”), we process your personal information in accordance with US privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act ( "CCPA"), Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring, Florida Digital Bill of Rights, Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act, Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act.

            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-6">
              <li><span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Exercising the right to know:</span> You have a right to request additional information about the categories of personal information collected, sold, disclosed, or shared; purposes for which this personal information was collected, sold, or shared; categories of sources of personal information; and categories of third parties with whom we disclosed or shared this personal information.</li>
              <li><span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Exercising the right to opt-out from a sale or sharing:</span> We do not transfer your personal data to third parties in exchange for payment. However, as noted above, we may provide the data to third party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our products and Services to you. Because these third parties may use the data LIQUID MIND® provides for their own purposes, LIQUID MIND®'s provision of data to these parties may be considered a data "sale" or "sharing" as those terms are defined under the CCPA and other applicable US privacy laws. You can opt out of targeted advertising and any related data "sales" or "sharing".</li>
              <li><span className="font-semibold text-foreground dark:text-white">Exercising the right to limit the use or sharing of Sensitive Personal Information:</span> We do not sell or share Sensitive Personal Information as defined by US privacy laws and have not done so in the past 12 months.

            <p>
              To submit a request to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us using the methods described in the Contact Us section below. Please note that rights under some U.S. state laws do not apply to Personal Data we collect, process, and disclose when you act as a consumer to obtain financial products or services from LIQUID MIND® primarily for your own personal family or household purposes. The federal Gramm-Leach Bliley Act may govern how LIQUID MIND® shares and protects that data instead. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your identity, including name, address, transaction history, photo identification, and other information associated with your account.
            </p>

            <p>
              You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Your agent may submit a request on your behalf by contacting us using the methods described in the Contact Us section below. We may still require you to directly verify your identity and confirm that you gave the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
